# Electricity-Billing-System-Java-Project-master
This java project is a contemporary take on the classic electricity billing system where a person gathers data from our electricity meter

The primary objective of this project is to automate the entire process to make it seamless, convenient, and effective. The software can compute the bill amount on the basis of units of electricity consumed in a month.
